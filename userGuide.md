## Using Your Website

### Recording Your Voice

Click "Start Recording" to begin capturing your voice. Speak naturally for up to 10 seconds about any topic - your feelings, your day, or anything on your mind. The beautiful 3D sphere will pulse and change color as you record, providing visual feedback.

### Analyzing Your Emotion

Once you click "Stop Recording", our AI analyzes your voice in real-time. The system detects seven emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, Sadness, and Surprise.

### Viewing Results

Your emotion analysis displays with a stunning 3D visualization rendered in a premium black 3D theme with glass-morphism effects. Each emotion has a unique visual representation: Anger shows a red icosahedron spinning rapidly, Happiness displays a golden sphere with gentle pulses, Sadness renders a blue torus with calm rotation, and each emotion has its own color scheme and shape. The visualization includes dynamic particle effects, animated aura rings, and neon glow effects that intensify with your confidence score.

Below the 3D visualization, you'll see your primary emotion with a confidence score displayed in a glass-morphism card with neon glow. A detailed breakdown of all seven emotions with percentage scores helps you understand the full emotional spectrum detected in your voice. The interface uses advanced audio preprocessing to ensure maximum accuracy in emotion detection.
